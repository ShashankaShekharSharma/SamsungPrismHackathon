# Apex Survival Arina

Step into a living, breathing wilderness where you become the master observer of intelligent AI agents battling for survival. Watch as colorful, pulsating avatars navigate a beautifully crafted 12x12 grid world, each driven by their own neural network brain, making life-or-death decisions in real-time.

You'll witness emergent stories unfold before your eyes: the cautious explorer who meticulously maps every tree and water source, the risk-taker who races against time to find resources, the temperature manager who strategically starts fires to survive winter nights, and the tragic hero who falls to dehydration just steps from salvation. Each simulation becomes a unique drama where personalities clash and survival strategies compete.
